# Keck DRP Framework source code directory

The sub-directories:
- config
- core
- models
- pipelines
- utils
- unit_tests

contain the source code of the DRP framework.

The sub-directory examples contains supplemental code for testing and documentation.

Copies of the configuration file 'config.cfg' and the logger configuration file 'logger.cfg' are provided in 'examples'.
These configuration files may need to be modified when developing or testing in a new environment.

Similarly, the start-up scripts runTest\_harness.sh and runTest\_template.sh need to be adapted for the actual Python environment.
