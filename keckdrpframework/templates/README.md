# Template Pipeline

This directory contains a skeleton pipeline that can be used to start developing a new pipeline.

### Do not change anything in this directory.
Instead, make a copy of this directory and rename it appropriately according to your project.

A convenient shell script 'make_copy.sh' is provided.

For example:

    ./make_copy projectA
    
will create a new directory projectA in the parent directory.

After creating the new directory, run the command:

    ./runTest_projectA.sh -d ../unit_tests/test_files
    
to verify that new skeleton pipeline is working properly.

After creating *projectA*, it can be moved to another location.
